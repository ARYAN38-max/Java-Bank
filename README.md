# Java-Bank
Hello welcome to Java-Bank. This ban is only made for fun rather to implement the skills learned in the wounderfull journey of learning java.
using this bank is not Gnarly it is very simple. On each step the application itself provides you the steps of using it, you just have to understand and co-operate with the app.
writing of this sesquipedalian code took around 5 to 6 hours, but no worries you have the code just clone and enjoy.
NOTE: In your terminal before using the app first type "javac BankManagementSystem.java" to compile.
After compiling in your folder three more files will be created i.e  Bank.class, Customer.class and SavingAccount.class. 
only use Bank.class file by typing "java Bank" in your terminal. This command will start the bank and you are ready to do some Grandiloquent in front of your friends
ENJOY!!:)
